The **Which-Key Modal** is a Vim-inspired feature that displays available keybindings as you type, helping you discover and remember keyboard shortcuts without memorizing them all.

## How to Enable

Add this to your `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "which_key": {
    "enabled": true
  }
}
```

## How It Works

1. Start typing a keybinding sequence (e.g., press `g` in Vim mode)
2. A compact panel appears in the bottom-right showing available continuations
3. See all possible commands and their keybindings at a glance
4. Complete your action or discover new shortcuts

This feature is especially valuable when transitioning from Vim or when you have many custom keybindings configured.
