Zed now supports **EditorConfig inheritance** from parent directories. If you have organization-wide or machine-wide editor settings, place them in a parent directory and all nested projects will inherit them.

## How It Works

When Zed finds a `.editorconfig` file in your project, it also traverses **parent directories** up to the filesystem root looking for additional config files. Settings are applied in order:

1. Furthest parent config (applied first)
2. Closer parent configs (override)
3. Project config (final override)

## Example Setup

```
/Users/you/
  .editorconfig         # Personal defaults
  /company/
    .editorconfig       # Company standards
    /project-a/
      .editorconfig     # Project-specific
    /project-b/
      .editorconfig     # Project-specific
```

In this setup:
- `project-a` inherits from `/company/.editorconfig` and `/Users/you/.editorconfig`
- Project configs override company configs
- Company configs override personal configs

## Stopping Inheritance

Use `root = true` in any `.editorconfig` to stop looking in parent directories:

```ini
# /company/.editorconfig
root = true

[*]
indent_style = space
indent_size = 2
```

Now projects under `/company/` won't inherit from `/Users/you/.editorconfig`.

## Common Use Cases

**Organization standards**: Put company coding style in a parent directory shared by all projects.

**Machine-wide defaults**: Set your personal preferences once at `~/.editorconfig` for all projects.

**Monorepo configurations**: Have workspace-level settings with package-level overrides.

**Team consistency**: Ensure everyone inherits the same base settings, with project-specific tweaks.

## How External Configs Are Loaded

- **Local projects**: File watchers detect changes immediately
- **Remote/SSH projects**: Configs are sent to remote clients
- **Collab/sharing**: External configs are shared with guests

Perfect for teams that want consistent editor settings across multiple projects without duplicating config files!
