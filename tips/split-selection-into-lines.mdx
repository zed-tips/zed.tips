Need to edit multiple lines at once? The **Split Selection Into Lines** action (`editor: split selection into lines`) creates a cursor on each line within your selection, perfect for bulk text manipulation.

This is incredibly useful when you need to:

1. **Select** the text you want to edit (can be the entire buffer with `Cmd-A`)
2. Use the command palette (`Cmd-Shift-P`) and search for "split selection into lines"
3. **Edit** all lines simultaneously with multicursors

Common use cases:

- Add prefixes or suffixes to multiple lines (e.g., adding quotes or commas)
- Delete the same characters from the start or end of many lines
- Indent or format multiple lines at once
- Convert a list into array elements or function arguments

For example, converting a list like:
```
apple
banana
cherry
```

Into an array by adding quotes and commas:
```javascript
"apple",
"banana",
"cherry",
```

Just select all lines, split into lines, press `Home` to go to the start, add `"`, press `End` to go to the end, and add `",`.
