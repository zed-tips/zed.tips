Need to stop an agent thread that's taking too long or heading in the wrong direction? You can now press `ESC` from anywhere in the agent panel to interrupt the running thread—no need to specifically focus the text input box.

## How It Works

**Before**: You had to click into the message editor and then press `ESC` to interrupt a thread.

**Now**: Press `ESC` while focused anywhere in the agent panel conversation area to immediately stop the running thread.

This works when:
- Reading through the agent's response
- Reviewing code changes
- Scrolling through the conversation history
- Anywhere else in the agent panel

## When to Use It

Interrupt a thread when you want to:

- **Stop unnecessary work**: The agent is doing more than needed
- **Change direction**: You realize you need a different approach
- **Save tokens**: The response is getting too long or off-track
- **Provide feedback**: You want to give the agent new instructions
- **Cancel by mistake**: You started a thread unintentionally

## Quick Workflow

1. Ask the agent to do something
2. Watch the response stream in
3. If it's not what you want, just press `ESC`
4. Provide new instructions or refine your request

No more clicking around to find the input box—just hit `ESC` and you're in control!

## Related Features

- The terminal tool also captures output up to the point you stop it
- The agent can see what was running when you interrupted
- Stopping operations is now more responsive overall

This small improvement makes working with agents feel much more natural and puts you in the driver's seat.
