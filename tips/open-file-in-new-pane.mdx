Want to view multiple files side-by-side? You can open a file in a new pane without manually splitting your workspace first.

Hold **`Option`** (macOS) or **`Alt`** (Linux/Windows) while clicking a file in:
- The project panel
- File finder results (`Cmd-P`)
- Search results

The file will open in a new pane next to your current editor, automatically splitting your workspace.

This is perfect for:
- Comparing two related files (e.g., component and its test)
- Referencing documentation while coding
- Keeping configuration files visible while editing code
- Reviewing multiple files from search results

You can also use the command palette and search for "split" actions to arrange your panes exactly how you want them.
