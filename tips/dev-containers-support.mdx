Zed now supports **Dev Containers**, allowing you to develop inside Docker containers with consistent, reproducible development environments.

## What are Dev Containers?

Dev Containers let you use a Docker container as a full-featured development environment. This ensures everyone on your team uses the same tools, runtime versions, and dependencies.

## How to Use

1. Add a `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file to your project root
2. Open your project in Zed
3. Zed will detect the Dev Container configuration
4. Choose to open the project in the container

## Example Configuration

```json
{
  "name": "Node.js Dev Container",
  "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/javascript-node:18",
  "customizations": {
    "zed": {
      "extensions": ["eslint", "prettier"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Benefits

- **Consistency**: Same environment across all developers
- **Isolation**: Project dependencies don't conflict with system packages
- **Onboarding**: New team members get started instantly
- **Clean**: Keep your local machine clean

Perfect for teams working with multiple tech stacks or complex dependency requirements.
