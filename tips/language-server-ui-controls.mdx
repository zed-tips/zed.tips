Zed now provides UI controls to restart or stop individual language servers, making it easier to troubleshoot LSP issues without reaching for terminal commands.

## How to Access

1. Look for the language server indicator in the status bar (bottom-right)
2. Click on the language server name
3. You'll see options to:
   - **Restart** - Restart the specific language server
   - **Stop** - Completely stop the language server
   - View the language server version (on hover)

## When to Use

**Restart** when code completion stops working, diagnostics aren't updating, or after changing LSP configuration.

**Stop** when troubleshooting performance issues or temporarily disabling LSP features.

Much faster than restarting the entire editor—hover over the language server name to see its version.
