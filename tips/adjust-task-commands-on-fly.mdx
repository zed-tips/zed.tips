When spawning a task in Zed, you can **edit the command** before running it, making it easy to quickly iterate with different parameters or options without creating multiple task configurations.

## How to Use

1. Open the command palette (`Cmd-Shift-P`)
2. Search for "task: spawn"
3. Select your task from the list
4. **Before the task runs**, you'll see the command in the modal
5. Edit the command as needed (add flags, change arguments, etc.)
6. Press `Enter` to run the modified command

This is incredibly useful for:
- **Testing different flags**: Try `cargo test --nocapture` vs `cargo test`
- **Running specific tests**: Change `npm test` to `npm test -- specific-test.js`
- **Adding debug output**: Add `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` or `DEBUG=*` to commands
- **Quick experiments**: Modify build commands without editing task configs

The original task configuration remains unchanged, so you can always run the default version or modify it again next time.

For example, you might have a "run tests" task, but want to add `--watch` mode just this once - simply edit the command in the modal before running it!
