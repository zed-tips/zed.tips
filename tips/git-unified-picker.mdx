Zed now provides a **unified Git picker** that combines branches, worktrees, and stashes into a single, tabbed interface. No more hunting through the command palette to find the picker you need!

## How to Access

Use the command palette to open any Git picker:

- `git: branches` - Opens the unified picker on the Branches tab
- `git: worktree` - Opens the unified picker on the Worktrees tab
- `git: view stash` - Opens the unified picker on the Stashes tab

Once inside, you can easily switch between tabs without returning to the command palette.

## Why It's Better

**Before**: Branch, worktree, and stash pickers were separate commands scattered in the command palette, making them hard to discover and access.

**Now**: All Git pickers are consolidated in one place with tab navigation, making it easy to switch between different Git entities.

## Key Benefits

- **Better discoverability**: Worktree and stash pickers are no longer hidden in the command palette
- **Faster workflow**: Switch between branches, worktrees, and stashes without reopening pickers
- **AI-friendly**: As worktrees become more important for AI-assisted workflows, they're now easier to access
- **Consistent experience**: All Git operations feel connected and related

## Perfect For

- **Managing worktrees**: Especially useful for AI agents working in isolated environments
- **Quick context switching**: Jump between branches while viewing stashes
- **Stash management**: Easier to find and apply stashes when needed
- **Multi-tasking**: Work on multiple features simultaneously with worktrees

The unified picker makes Git operations feel more cohesive and puts all your version control tools within easy reach!
