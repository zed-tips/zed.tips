The Git panel now supports **Tree View**, making it easier to navigate and understand file changes organized by directory structure.

## How to Switch Views

1. Open the Git panel with `Cmd+Shift+G` (macOS) or `Ctrl+Shift+G` (Linux/Windows)
2. Look for the view toggle button in the panel header
3. Switch between:
   - **Flat View**: All files in a flat list
   - **Tree View**: Files organized by directory hierarchy

## Benefits of Tree View

**Better Organization**
- See changes grouped by folder
- Understand the scope of changes at a glance
- Navigate large changesets more easily

**Familiar Structure**
- Matches your project's directory layout
- Expand/collapse folders to focus on specific areas
- Quickly locate files in deeply nested structures

## Use Cases

- **Large Refactorings**: Easily see which directories were affected
- **Feature Work**: Group related file changes together
- **Code Reviews**: Understand change context by folder
- **Multi-Module Projects**: Navigate between different modules

Switch views based on your workflow—use flat view for quick scans, tree view for organized exploration.
