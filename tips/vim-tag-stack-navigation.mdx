Vim users rejoice! Zed now supports **tag stack navigation** - a dedicated history for "Go to Definition" jumps. Instead of mixing definition jumps with your regular navigation history, they're tracked in a separate stack.

## How It Works

Every time you use "Go to Definition" (or hover links), Zed records:
- **Origin**: Where you jumped from
- **Target**: Where you jumped to

These are stored in a separate tag stack, independent of your regular back/forward history.

## Navigation Commands

Use these new commands to navigate the tag stack:

- **`pane: go to older tag`** - Jump back through definition history
- **`pane: go to newer tag`** - Jump forward through definition history

## Why It's Better Than Browser History

**Traditional browser-style history**: When you go back, you wade through every cursor movement, search, and file switch.

**Tag stack**: Only tracks definition jumps, so going back takes you directly to where you started the investigation - not through every intermediate step.

## Example Workflow

```
1. Working in app.tsx (origin)
2. Cmd+Click on UserService.login() → jumps to service.ts
3. Cmd+Click on authenticate() → jumps to auth.ts
4. Cmd+Click on validateToken() → jumps to token.ts

Now use "go to older tag":
- First press → back to auth.ts
- Second press → back to service.ts
- Third press → back to app.tsx (your original location)
```

## Recommended Keybindings

For Vim users, consider mapping to traditional Vim tag bindings:

```json
{
  "context": "VimControl && !menu",
  "bindings": {
    "ctrl-]": "editor::GoToDefinition",
    "ctrl-t": "pane::GoToOlderTag"
  }
}
```

This brings familiar Vim tag navigation to Zed!
