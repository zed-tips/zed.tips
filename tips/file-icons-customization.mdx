Zed ships with monochrome file icons by default, but if you want to add more visual flair to your project panel, you can install the **Catppuccin Icons** extension for vibrant, colorful icons.

## Installation

1. Open the extensions view (command palette → `zed: extensions`)
2. Search for **Catppuccin Icons**
3. Hit the **Install** button
4. Open the Icon Theme selector (command palette → `icon theme selector: toggle`)
5. Pick your favorite Catppuccin variant

Now your project panel has clear visual distinctions between file types with colorful, recognizable icons!

## Bonus: Show Icons in Tabs

You can also add file icons to your tabs for even better visual organization. Add this to your Zed settings:

```json
{
  "tabs": {
    "file_icons": true
  }
}
```

Or configure it through the command palette → `settings: open default settings` and search for "tabs".
