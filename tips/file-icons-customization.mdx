Zed allows you to customize file and folder icons in the project panel with the **file icon flair** setting, choosing between subtle monochrome icons or vibrant colorful ones.

## Configuration

Add this to your Zed settings:

```json
{
  "file_icons": {
    "flair": "colorful"  // or "monochrome"
  }
}
```

## Options

**Monochrome** (default):
- Clean, minimal aesthetic
- Icons use your theme's muted colors
- Less visual distraction
- Professional appearance

**Colorful**:
- Vibrant, recognizable icons
- Each file type has distinct colors
- Easier to spot specific file types at a glance
- More personality

The colorful option is particularly helpful when working with many different file types, as the distinctive colors make it easier to quickly identify files in the project panel.

Try both settings and see which works better for your workflow and visual preferences!
