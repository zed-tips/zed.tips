Zed now includes a built-in command to create pull requests for your current branch, streamlining your Git workflow without switching to the browser.

## How to Use

1. Ensure you're on the branch you want to create a PR for
2. Open the command palette with `Cmd+Shift+P` (macOS) or `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Linux/Windows)
3. Type "git: create pull request"
4. Press `Enter`

Zed will open your default browser with the PR creation page pre-filled with your branch information.

## Requirements

- Your branch must be pushed to the remote repository
- Works with GitHub, GitLab, and other platforms that support PR URLs
- Automatically detects your repository's remote URL

## Workflow

1. Make your changes in Zed
2. Stage and commit using the Git panel (`Cmd+Shift+G`)
3. Push to remote from the terminal
4. Create PR with `git: create pull request` command

No more context switching between editor, terminal, and browser!
