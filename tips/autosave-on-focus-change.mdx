Tired of manually saving files before running tests or build commands? Enable **auto-save on focus change** to automatically save your files whenever you switch from the editor to the terminal or another application.

Add this to your Zed settings:

```json
{
  "autosave": "on_focus_change"
}
```

Now when you:
- Switch from an editor pane to a terminal pane
- Alt-Tab to another application
- Click outside of the editor

Your file is automatically saved, ensuring your tests and builds always run with your latest changes.

This is particularly useful for test-driven development workflows where you're frequently switching between editing code and running tests. No more failed tests because you forgot to save!

Other autosave options include:
- `"off"` - Never auto-save (default)
- `"on_window_change"` - Save when switching to a different window
- `"on_focus_change"` - Save when focus leaves the editor pane
