Love using [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) for Git operations? You can configure it as a Zed task to launch it directly in the integrated terminal.

Add this to your project's `.zed/tasks.json`:

```json
[
  {
    "label": "lazygit",
    "command": "lazygit",
    "use_new_terminal": true
  }
]
```

Now you can:
1. Open the command palette (`Cmd-Shift-P`)
2. Search for "task: spawn"
3. Select "lazygit" from the list

Lazygit will launch in a new terminal pane, giving you full access to its TUI for staging, committing, pushing, rebasing, and all other Git operations without leaving Zed.

This works with any terminal-based tool you frequently use - just add it as a task configuration!

**Note:** Make sure lazygit is installed on your system first:
- macOS: `brew install lazygit`
- Linux: See [installation instructions](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit#installation)
