The **Go to File** feature in Zed allows you to quickly navigate to any file in your project without leaving your keyboard.

## How to Use

1. Press `Cmd+P` (macOS) or `Ctrl+P` (Linux/Windows)
2. Start typing the filename
3. Use fuzzy search to find files quickly
4. Press `Enter` to open the file

## Pro Tips

- You don't need to type the full filename - just key letters work!
- Use `/` to navigate through directory paths
- Combine with `Cmd+Shift+P` for the command palette

This shortcut dramatically speeds up your workflow by eliminating the need to manually browse file trees.
