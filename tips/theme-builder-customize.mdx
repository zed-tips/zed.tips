Zed's official **Theme Builder** lets you create and customize themes visually without writing any code. Whether you want to tweak an existing theme or build one from scratch, the Theme Builder makes it easy.

## Getting Started

1. Visit [zed.dev/theme-builder](https://zed.dev/theme-builder)
2. Choose a base theme to start from, or begin with a blank canvas
3. Customize colors using the visual editor
4. Preview your changes in real-time

## Key Features

**Visual Color Picker**: Click on any UI element to customize its color. No need to remember JSON structure or color codes.

**Real-time Preview**: See your changes instantly in a live Zed editor preview, showing how your theme looks with actual code.

**Export & Share**: When you're done, export your theme as a JSON file or share it with the community.

## How to Use Your Custom Theme

After creating your theme:

1. Export the theme JSON from Theme Builder
2. Add it to your Zed themes directory:
   - macOS: `~/.config/zed/themes/`
   - Linux: `~/.config/zed/themes/`
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Zed\themes\`
3. Select your theme from the theme picker (`theme selector: toggle` in command palette)

## Pro Tips

- Start with a theme you already like and make small adjustments
- Test your theme with different file types (Rust, JavaScript, Markdown, etc.)
- Pay attention to both light and dark variants if you switch between them
- Share your themes on the [Zed Extensions repository](https://github.com/zed-industries/extensions)

No more editing JSON by hand—create beautiful themes the easy way!
