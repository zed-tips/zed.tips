On macOS, you can now use **Force Touch** (deep press) on symbols to quickly jump to their definitions—no keyboard shortcuts needed.

## How to Use

1. Hover your cursor over a function, class, or variable name
2. Press firmly on your trackpad (Force Touch/3D Touch)
3. Zed immediately jumps to the definition

Works with any symbol that supports go-to-definition in your language.

## Setup

Force Touch works out of the box on MacBooks with Force Touch trackpads (2015 and later).

Make sure Force Touch is enabled in System Settings:
- **System Settings** → **Trackpad** → **Force Click and haptic feedback**

## Comparison

**Traditional Method**:
- Hover over symbol
- Press `Cmd+Click` or `F12`

**Force Touch Method**:
- Just Force Touch the symbol
- One gesture instead of two actions

## Benefits

- Faster navigation with one gesture
- Keeps hands on trackpad
- Natural tactile feedback
- Works alongside traditional shortcuts

Perfect for trackpad-centric workflows—explore code without reaching for keyboard shortcuts.
