When working with many pinned tabs, they can consume significant horizontal space, leaving little room for your active working tabs. The **separate row for pinned tabs** feature solves this by displaying pinned and unpinned tabs in two distinct rows.

## The Problem

With multiple pinned tabs in a single row:
- Working tabs get squeezed and become hard to read
- Constant scrolling to find active tabs
- Tab names get truncated on smaller screens
- Wasted horizontal space mixing two different types of tabs

## The Solution

Enable two-row tab layout to get:
- **Top row**: All your pinned tabs (references, configs, important files)
- **Bottom row**: Working tabs with full horizontal space
- **Automatic switching**: Shows single row when only one type exists
- **Familiar pattern**: Used by JetBrains IDEs, Visual Studio, and Eclipse

## Configuration

**Via Settings UI**:
1. Open Settings (`Cmd-,` / `Ctrl-,`)
2. Go to Editor section
3. Toggle "Pinned Tabs Layout"

**Via `settings.json`**:
```json
{
  "tab_bar": {
    "show_pinned_tabs_in_separate_row": true
  }
}
```

## Smart Behavior

The layout adapts automatically:
- **Both types present**: Two rows (pinned on top, unpinned on bottom)
- **Only pinned tabs**: Single row
- **Only unpinned tabs**: Single row
- **Empty**: No tab bar clutter

## Benefits

**More readable tabs**: Full width for file names without truncation

**Better organization**: Visual separation between reference and working files

**Faster navigation**: Know exactly where to look for each type of tab

**Maximized space**: No wasted horizontal real estate

**Flexible workflow**: Adapts to your working style

## Perfect For

- **Reference-heavy work**: Keep docs, configs, and READMEs pinned
- **Multi-file projects**: Work on many files simultaneously
- **Small screens**: Make the most of limited horizontal space
- **Tab enthusiasts**: Manage dozens of tabs without chaos

This is an opt-in feature that defaults to `false`, so existing users see no change. Enable it when you need better tab organization!
