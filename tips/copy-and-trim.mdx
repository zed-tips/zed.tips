When copying code snippets from nested blocks, you often don't want the extra indentation. The **Copy and Trim** feature in Zed's editor context menu automatically removes leading whitespace when copying selected text.

Instead of copying text like this:

```json
            "diagnostics": {
                "inline": {
                    "enabled": true
                }
            },
```

Copy and Trim gives you clean, unindented text ready to paste:

```json
"diagnostics": {
    "inline": {
        "enabled": true
    }
},
```

Right-click on any selection in the editor and choose **Copy and Trim** from the context menu to use this feature.
