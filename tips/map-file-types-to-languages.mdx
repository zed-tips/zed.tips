Out of the box, Zed can recognize most common languages based on a file's extension. It knows to both apply JavaScript syntax highlighting and start a JavaScript language server if the file has `.js` as its extension.

Zed will treat files with extensions it doesn't recognize, such as `.jsm`, as plaintext files. However, you can tell Zed to treat these files as ones it understands.

## Temporary Override

Use the language selector (command palette → `language selector: toggle` → `JavaScript`) to temporarily override a file's language.

**Drawback**: This is only a temporary override. Zed will forget about this association the moment you close the file.

## Persistent Mapping

To persist this association, configure a mapping via the `file_types` setting in your `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "file_types": {
    "JavaScript": ["*.jsm"]
  }
}
```

Now, every time you open a `.jsm` file, it will be treated as a `.js` file.

## More Examples

`file_types` supports glob patterns:

```json
{
  "file_types": {
    "JavaScript": ["*.mjs", "*.cjs", "*.jsm"],
    "Markdown": ["*.mdx"],
    "JSON": [".eslintrc", "*.jsonc"],
    "YAML": ["*.yml", ".yamllint"]
  }
}
```

## Best Practice

It is always best to first browse Zed's extension store (command palette → `zed: extensions`) to see if direct support for your language already exists. If it does not, `file_types` is a great workaround to get syntax highlighting and language server support for custom file extensions.
