With dozens of AI models available in Zed's agent panel, finding your preferred models can be time-consuming. The **favorite models** feature pins your most-used models to the top of the list for instant access.

## How to Mark Favorites

1. Open the agent panel or inline assistant
2. Click the model selector dropdown
3. Hover over any model to reveal the star icon
4. Click the star to mark/unmark as favorite

Favorited models appear in a dedicated section at the top of the list, separated from other models.

## Quick Switching with Alt-Tab

Once you've marked multiple models as favorites, you can cycle through them:

- Press `Alt+Tab` to switch to the next favorite model
- Perfect for comparing responses from different models
- Works in agent threads, text threads, and inline assistant

## Configuration

You can also manually configure favorites in `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "favorite_models": [
      "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4",
      "openai/gpt-4",
      "openai/o1"
    ]
  }
}
```

No more scrolling through long model lists—your preferred models are always one click away!
