Zed's AI-generated commit messages now respect custom **rules files** like `AGENTS.md`, ensuring generated messages follow your team's commit conventions.

## How It Works

1. Create an `AGENTS.md` file in your repository root
2. Define your commit message rules and conventions
3. When generating AI commit messages, Zed will follow these rules

## Example Rules File

Create `.github/AGENTS.md` or `AGENTS.md`:

```markdown
# Commit Message Guidelines

## Format
- Use conventional commits: `type(scope): description`
- Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
- Keep first line under 50 characters
- Use imperative mood: "add" not "added"

## Examples
- feat(auth): add OAuth2 login support
- fix(api): handle null response in user endpoint
- docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

## Benefits

**Consistency**: All commits follow the same style, even AI-generated ones

**Team Alignment**: New team members learn conventions through AI suggestions

**Automation**: Let AI handle formatting while you focus on the changes

## Use Cases

- Conventional Commits format
- Ticket number prefixes (e.g., `[JIRA-123]`)
- Emoji conventions (e.g., ✨ for features)
- Character limits and formatting rules

The AI reads your rules and generates commit messages that match your team's standards automatically.
