If you're coming from JetBrains IDEs (IntelliJ, WebStorm, PyCharm) and miss the instant auto-save behavior, you can configure Zed to save files immediately on every keystroke—no delays, no focus changes required.

## The Difference

**Default Zed behavior**: Files auto-save after you stop typing for a moment or when you change focus.

**JetBrains style**: Files save instantly after every change, whether you change focus or not.

## Configuration

Add this to your `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "autosave": {
    "after_delay": {
      "milliseconds": 0
    }
  }
}
```

That's it! Now every keystroke is instantly saved to disk.

## When to Use This

This works great if you:

- **Trust your auto-formatters**: Files are saved before formatting, so you see formatted code immediately
- **Use file watchers**: Tools like webpack, vite, or nodemon pick up changes instantly
- **Never worry about unsaved changes**: No more "Save changes?" dialogs
- **Work with external tools**: Other tools always see the latest file version

## Comparison with Other Auto-Save Options

### Focus Change (Default)
```json
{
  "autosave": "on_focus_change"
}
```
✅ Saves only when you switch files or apps
❌ Doesn't save while you're actively editing

### After Delay (JetBrains Style)
```json
{
  "autosave": {
    "after_delay": {
      "milliseconds": 0
    }
  }
}
```
✅ Saves immediately after every change
✅ Works even if you stay in the same file
⚠️ More disk writes (usually not a problem on modern SSDs)

### Delayed Save (Balanced)
```json
{
  "autosave": {
    "after_delay": {
      "milliseconds": 1000
    }
  }
}
```
✅ Saves after 1 second of inactivity
✅ Fewer disk writes than instant save
❌ Small delay before changes are saved

## Benefits

**No manual saves**: Never press `Cmd-S` / `Ctrl-S` again

**Immediate feedback**: See formatter and linter results right away

**Peace of mind**: Your work is always saved

**Familiar**: Works like the IDEs you're used to

## Potential Downsides

- **More disk writes**: Every keystroke triggers a save (modern SSDs handle this easily)
- **Formatter triggers**: If you have format-on-save enabled, it runs on every change (you might want to disable this)

## Related Settings

You might also want to adjust format-on-save behavior:

```json
{
  "autosave": {
    "after_delay": {
      "milliseconds": 0
    }
  },
  "format_on_save": "off"  // Format manually instead
}
```

Or keep format-on-save but add a small delay:

```json
{
  "autosave": {
    "after_delay": {
      "milliseconds": 500
    }
  },
  "format_on_save": "on"
}
```

This gives you a half-second buffer to type before the formatter runs, reducing unnecessary formatting operations while still providing quick saves.
