When working with the Agent panel, understanding the performance and cost of your AI interactions can be valuable. The **turn statistics** feature displays real-time metrics about your agent conversations.

## What You'll See

With turn statistics enabled, the agent panel displays:

- **Timer**: How long the current operation has been running
- **Token count**: Number of tokens used in the conversation
- **Turn indicator**: Whose turn it is (you or the agent)

This helps you:
- Estimate costs based on token usage
- Understand how "expensive" a request might be
- Get a sense of how much effort the agent is putting into a task
- Monitor performance in real-time

## How to Enable

Add this to your `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "show_turn_stats": true
  }
}
```

By default, this setting is `false` to keep the interface clean. Enable it when you want detailed insights into your agent interactions.

## Why It's Useful

This feature originated from Claude Code and helps developers:
- **Budget wisely**: Track token usage to manage API costs
- **Optimize prompts**: See which interactions use more resources
- **Debug issues**: Understand if the agent is working or stuck
- **Learn patterns**: Notice which tasks require more tokens/time

Perfect for power users who want visibility into their AI assistant's resource usage!
