For Vim users missing Telescope, you can integrate [Television](https://github.com/alexpasmantier/television) - a blazing fast fuzzy finder written in Rust - directly into Zed.

## Setup Steps

### 1. Install Television

```bash
# macOS
brew install television

# Or via Cargo
cargo install television
```

### 2. Add Task Configuration

Add this to your `tasks.json`:

```json
{
  "label": "Television File Finder",
  "command": "zed \"$(tv files)\"",
  "hide": "always",
  "allow_concurrent_runs": true,
  "use_new_terminal": true
}
```

### 3. Bind to Keybinding

Add this to your `keymap.json` to replace the default file finder:

```json
{
  "bindings": {
    "cmd-p": [  // Or `ctrl-p` on Windows/Linux
      "task::Spawn",
      { "task_name": "Television File Finder", "reveal_target": "center" }
    ]
  }
}
```

## How It Works

Now when you press `Cmd-P` (or `Ctrl-P`), Television will launch instead of Zed's built-in file finder. You get:

- **Blazing fast fuzzy finding** powered by Rust
- **Familiar Telescope-like interface** for Vim users
- **Automatic file opening** - selected files open directly in Zed
- **Git-aware searching** and more advanced features

The `hide: "always"` setting keeps the task hidden from the task list, and `allow_concurrent_runs: true` lets you spawn multiple instances if needed.
