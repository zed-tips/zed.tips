For Vim users missing Telescope, you can integrate [Television](https://github.com/alexpasmantier/television) - a blazing fast fuzzy finder written in Rust - directly into Zed as a task.

## Installation

First, install Television:

```bash
# macOS
brew install television

# Cargo
cargo install television
```

## Configuration

Add this to your `.zed/tasks.json`:

```json
[
  {
    "label": "television",
    "command": "tv",
    "use_new_terminal": true,
    "reveal": "always"
  }
]
```

## How to Use

1. Open command palette (`Cmd-Shift-P`)
2. Search for "task: spawn"
3. Select "television"

Television will launch in a terminal pane with its powerful fuzzy finder interface, letting you search:
- Files across your project
- Git files only
- Text content
- Command history
- And more

It's significantly faster than built-in finders for large projects and provides a familiar interface for Vim users transitioning to Zed.

Bind it to a keyboard shortcut in your keymap for even quicker access!
