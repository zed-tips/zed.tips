Markdown files now display a **structured outline** that shows the hierarchical relationship between headings, making it easier to navigate documentation, blog posts, and long-form content.

## What Changed

**Before**: Markdown outlines showed all headings in a flat list, making it hard to understand document structure.

**Now**: Headings are displayed hierarchically (H1 > H2 > H3, etc.), reflecting the actual document organization.

## How to Access

Open the outline panel for any Markdown file:

- **Command Palette**: `outline: toggle`
- **Keyboard shortcut**: Configure in your keybindings
- **Menu**: View → Toggle Outline Panel

The outline automatically updates as you edit the document.

## Benefits

**Visual hierarchy**: Instantly see how sections and subsections relate

**Faster navigation**: Click any heading to jump directly to that section

**Better comprehension**: Understand document structure at a glance

**Improved editing**: Reorganize sections with full context of the hierarchy

**Sticky scroll support**: The breadcrumb now correctly shows your current heading when scrolling

## Perfect For

- **Documentation**: Navigate API docs, guides, and technical writing
- **Blog posts**: Jump between sections in long-form articles
- **READMEs**: Quickly find specific sections in project documentation
- **Notes**: Organize and browse hierarchical note structures
- **Books/Essays**: Work with complex document structures

## Related Improvements

This feature also fixes sticky scroll behavior in Markdown files—the breadcrumb now correctly displays your current heading as you scroll through the document.

## Example Structure

```
# Main Title
  ## Section 1
    ### Subsection 1.1
    ### Subsection 1.2
  ## Section 2
    ### Subsection 2.1
```

The outline displays this hierarchy visually, making navigation intuitive and efficient!
