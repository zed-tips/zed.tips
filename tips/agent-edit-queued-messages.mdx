When you send multiple prompts to the agent while it's still processing, they get queued. Now you can **edit those queued messages** before they're sent - perfect for when you realize you want to refine your request.

## How to Edit Queued Messages

1. Send a message to the agent while it's processing another
2. Your message gets added to the queue
3. Press **Cmd+E** from the message editor
4. The first queued message becomes editable
5. Make your changes and:
   - Press Enter to save changes (message stays queued)
   - Click "Send Now" to send immediately
   - Unfocus to keep editing later

## Key Behaviors

**Editing while processing**: If you're still editing when the queue reaches your message, it won't be sent automatically. You must explicitly click "Send Now."

**Context preservation**: Queued messages show all context buttons and mentions just like regular messages, so you can see exactly what will be sent.

**No layout shift**: The editor renders the same way whether editing or queued, making the experience smooth and predictable.

## Why It's Useful

- **Catch mistakes**: Fix typos or clarify instructions before the agent sees them
- **Add context**: Include additional @-mentions or details you initially forgot
- **Change direction**: Revise your approach based on the agent's current response
- **Better workflow**: Queue multiple rough ideas, then polish them before sending

This feature gives you complete control over your agent interactions, even when working at a fast pace!
