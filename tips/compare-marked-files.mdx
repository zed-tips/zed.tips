Need to compare two files? Zed makes it easy with the **Compare Marked Files** feature in the project panel context menu.

Here's how to use it:

1. Select the first file in the project panel
2. Hold `Cmd` (macOS) or `Ctrl` (Linux/Windows) and click the second file to mark both
3. Right-click on either selected file
4. Choose **Compare Marked Files** from the context menu

Zed will open a side-by-side diff view showing the differences between the two files, making it easy to spot changes and similarities.

This is particularly useful when comparing configuration files, reviewing different versions of a document, or checking implementations across similar files.
