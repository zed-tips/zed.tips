Configure Zed to automatically launch **tmux sessions** when opening a new terminal, giving you persistent terminal sessions with window management, even when closing and reopening Zed.

## Configuration

Add this to your Zed settings:

```json
{
  "terminal": {
    "shell": {
      "program": "tmux",
      "args": ["new-session", "-A", "-s", "zed-session"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Benefits

**Persistent Sessions**:
- Terminal state survives Zed restarts
- Background processes keep running
- Command history is preserved

**Window Management**:
- Split terminals within tmux
- Multiple windows per session
- Navigate with tmux keybindings

**Project-Specific Sessions**:
Use different session names per project:

```json
{
  "terminal": {
    "shell": {
      "program": "tmux",
      "args": ["new-session", "-A", "-s", "my-project"]
    }
  }
}
```

## How It Works

- `-A` attaches to existing session or creates new one
- `-s` specifies the session name
- When you close Zed, the tmux session continues running
- Reopen Zed and reconnect to the same session with all your state intact

Perfect for long-running dev servers, watch modes, or any process you want to persist across Zed sessions!
