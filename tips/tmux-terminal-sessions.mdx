If you're a tmux user, you can configure Zed to automatically attach to a project-specific tmux session when you open the terminal.

## Configuration

Add this to your `settings.json` file:

```json
{
  "terminal": {
    "shell": {
      "with_arguments": {
        "program": "/bin/zsh",  // or path to your preferred shell
        "args": ["-c", "tmux new-session -A -s \"$(basename \"$PWD\")\""]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## How It Works

This configuration uses `$(basename "$PWD")` to automatically name the tmux session after your current project directory. Each project gets its own dedicated tmux session.

The `-A` flag means "attach to existing session or create new one", so:
- First time opening a terminal in a project: creates a new tmux session
- Subsequent times: reconnects to the existing session
- Different projects: get different tmux sessions automatically

## Benefits

This is great for those who prefer **keyboard-driven workflows** for:
- **Selecting text** in the terminal
- **Copying output** with tmux copy mode
- **Navigating** through terminal history
- **Splitting panes** within tmux
- **Persistent sessions** that survive Zed restarts

You get all the power of tmux while working in Zed, with automatic project-based session management!
