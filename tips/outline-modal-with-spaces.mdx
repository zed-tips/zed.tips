The outline modal (`Cmd-Shift-O` on macOS, or `outline: toggle`) is great for quickly navigating to symbols in your current file. But did you know you can search by **both symbol name and context** using spaces?

By default, the search bar filters symbols by their name only. However, if you include a **space** in your search query, Zed expands the search to match against both the symbol's name and its containing scope.

For example, in a JavaScript file with:
```javascript
class UserService {
  async getUser() { ... }
}

class AdminService {
  async getUser() { ... }
}
```

Searching for `getUser` would show both methods. But searching for `admin getUser` (with a space) will only match the `getUser` method inside `AdminService`.

This is incredibly useful when:
- You have multiple symbols with the same name in different classes or namespaces
- You want to quickly jump to a specific method in a particular class
- You're working with large files containing many similarly-named functions

The space-based context search makes navigation much more precise and efficient!
