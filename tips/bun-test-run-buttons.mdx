Configure test runner tasks in Zed to get convenient **inline run buttons** next to your test functions, making it easy to run individual tests or test suites with a single click.

## Configuration

Add this to your project's `.zed/tasks.json` for Bun tests:

```json
[
  {
    "label": "test $ZED_SYMBOL",
    "command": "bun test --bail --test-name-pattern '$ZED_SYMBOL'"
  },
  {
    "label": "test $ZED_FILE",
    "command": "bun test --bail $ZED_FILE"
  }
]
```

## How It Works

Once configured, you'll see **run buttons** appear:
- Next to individual test functions (uses `$ZED_SYMBOL`)
- At the top of test files (uses `$ZED_FILE`)

Click the button to run just that test or file, making test-driven development much faster.

## Works With Other Runners

This pattern works with any test runner:

**Jest/Vitest:**
```json
{
  "label": "test $ZED_SYMBOL",
  "command": "npm test -- -t '$ZED_SYMBOL'"
}
```

**Rust:**
```json
{
  "label": "test $ZED_SYMBOL",
  "command": "cargo test $ZED_SYMBOL"
}
```

The `$ZED_SYMBOL` and `$ZED_FILE` variables are automatically replaced with the current symbol name and file path!
