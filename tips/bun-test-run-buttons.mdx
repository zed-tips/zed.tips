If you're a JS/TS developer who uses Bun and your project has `@types/bun` in `package.json`, Zed will automatically surface `bun test` run tasks for you.

If you are using a different setup where Bun isn't automatically detected, here's how to add `bun test` run tasks yourself.

## Configuration

Add the following to your `tasks.json` file:

```json
[
  {
    "label": "Bun Test",
    "command": "bun test",
    "args": ["\"$ZED_RELATIVE_FILE\" -t=\"$ZED_SYMBOL\""],
    "tags": ["js-test", "ts-test", "bun-test", "tsx-test"]
  }
]
```

## How It Works

The `tags` field is crucial - it tells Zed which file types should display the run buttons. With the tags configured above, you'll see **play buttons in the gutter** of your JavaScript, TypeScript, and TSX test files.

Click the button to run your tests with Bun:
- Next to individual test functions (uses `$ZED_SYMBOL`)
- At the file level to run all tests in that file

## Key Configuration Elements

- **`$ZED_RELATIVE_FILE`**: The current file path relative to the project root
- **`$ZED_SYMBOL`**: The current symbol (test name) under the cursor
- **`tags`**: Specifies which file types get the run buttons (crucial for making this work!)

This pattern works with any test runner - just adjust the command and tags accordingly.
